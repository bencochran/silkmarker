SilkMarker
==========

SilkMarker extends the Google Map API's GMarker and adds support
for dynamically-created markers based on the [Silk Icon set][silk] by Mark
James.

You use it by specifying a baseMarker, which acts as an underlay, and an
overlayIcon, which is the icon to place on the underlying marker.

Download
--------

SilkMarker is very much in beta currently. If you're interested in tracking the
progress, however, check out the [repository][repository].
